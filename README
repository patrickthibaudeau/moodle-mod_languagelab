LANGUAGE LAB

This module is an audio recording module to replace traditional language labs. It's goal is to offer a high quality system that is affordable.

-------------------------------
Prerequisites
-------------------------------
Obviously, you will need a functional version of Moodle 2.x.x, full access to the root folder and admin rights within your Moodle installation.

You will need a Red5 Server. We suggest version 8 or above. Red5 can be downloaded at the following site: http://code.google.com/p/red5/
Select the proper version for your OS. Once installed you will need to install ofla demo. Follow the instructions from Red5.


Once you have Red5 installed, either write down the IP address of your server or get a FQDN. You will need it in order for Red5 to work.
NOTE: Using localhost will NOT work.

Installation

1. copy all folders (filter, mod, lib ) into the appropriate moodle(root) folder.
2. Login to Moodle with admin rights.
3. In the Site Administration block, click on Notifications. This will setup the database tables for the languagelab module
4. In the settings block, select Site administration -> Plugins -> Activities Modules -> Manage activities -> Language lab -> settings
6. Enter the IP address or the FQDN that you noted previously in the appropriate fields and save changes.

        Also Remember, you cannot use localhost, even if Red5 is installed on the same physical server as Moodle.

Your done. Go into a course, turn editing on and add a language lab activity.
